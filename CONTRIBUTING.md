## Installing and starting a http-server
Node.js has a http-server package that can be used to run a simple local web server. If youâ€™ve got node installed open a command line at the directory your content is in.

Installing the Node.js http-server is simple.

npm install http-server -g
This will install the http-server package globally. Now we can start the server to serve the files in the current directory.

http-server . -p 8000

Weâ€™re executing the http-server Node.js application, giving it a dot to indicate it is to serve files from the current directory (this could be replaced with a path) and using -p 8000 to tell the server to run on port 8000

You should then be able to access it using localhost:8000 in your web browser.

To stop the server when finished you can just press Ctrl+c in the terminal.
